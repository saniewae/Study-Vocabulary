# Study Vocabulary

An interactive tool I built to practice a selected set of words I came across while preparing for the SSAT. Users can flip cards to see pronunciation, definition, example sentences and test themselves with quizzes that track correct and incorrect answers.

## Features
- Flip-style flashcards for active learning
- Quizzes with scoring to track performance
- Pronunciation guides and example sentences

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Deployment
- Hosted and deployed using Netlifly

## How to Use
1. Open the website in your browser
2. Flip each card to learn the word, pronunciation, definition, and an example sentence
3. Switch to quiz mode to test yourself and track your correct and incorrect answers
4. Repeat as needed

## Future Plans
- Add more vocabulary levels and categories
- Improve quiz functionality with timers or multiple rounds
- Make the site more interactive and user-friendly
